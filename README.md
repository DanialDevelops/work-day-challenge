# work-day-challenge

## A Work day scheduler 

In this project I worked on making a work day scheduler that saves notes applied to it while also displaying the real time and indicating whether its the past present or future by colours.

### Things I worked on
-local storage to save the data 

-Jqurey syntax making the code look more condensed and clean

-worked with dayjs to add time and day values to the page

-also worked with data-time to make it easier for js to interact with the time varibles on the page
